# Gender-Biasness
This project aims to detect gender bias in news articles through a combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. We started with a dataset containing article titles, content, authors, and news sources, and applied various text analytics and machine learning methods to achieve our goals. The project includes lexicon-based sentiment analysis, gender detection using pronoun matching, and a comprehensive gender bias analysis. Additionally, we employed several machine learning algorithms, including traditional models and deep learning techniques, to predict sentiment and gender representation in news articles. Initial findings indicate a balanced representation of genders across different sentiment categories. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models, incorporating advanced NLP techniques, and exploring additional factors for a more robust gender bias detection system.
